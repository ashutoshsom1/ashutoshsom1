  <p align="center">
    I am an analyst specializing in creating innovative solutions that drive productivity, accuracy, and strategic decision-making. With expertise in invoice management systems, integrating GPT models for tabular data analysis, and leveraging Azure Cognitive Services like Form Recognizer and Vision AI, I bring a versatile skill set to the table.
    <br />
    <br />
    In the realm of invoice management, I have collaborated with clients to develop advanced systems that revolutionize review and validation processes. By creating a robust classification model, I accurately differentiate handwritten and machine-printed invoices. Leveraging OCR and pattern matching techniques, I extract essential information, enhancing data accuracy and facilitating precise record-keeping.
    <br />
    <br />
    Recognizing the challenges of using GPT models consistently for tabular data decision-making, I conducted extensive research and developed an innovative approach. By combining GPT models with advanced preprocessing and feature engineering, I created a system that extracts and analyzes crucial information from tabular datasets, empowering organizations to make confident data-driven decisions.
    <br />
    <br />
    Furthermore, I have harnessed the power of Azure Cognitive Services, including Form Recognizer and Vision AI, to automate data extraction and analysis. Leveraging Form Recognizer, I developed intelligent systems that accurately process and extract information from diverse forms and documents. By incorporating Vision AI capabilities, I improved the accuracy and reliability of data extraction from images, unlocking valuable insights from unstructured visual content.
    <br />
    <br />
    In addition to my practical experience, I hold a bachelor's degree in computer science engineering and continually seek opportunities to expand my skills and stay at the forefront of emerging technologies.
    <br />
    <br />
    If you are seeking a dedicated professional who can optimize processes, automate data extraction, and have a passion for leveraging AI and ML to drive efficiency and unlock valuable insights from diverse datasets, I am eager to connect and explore potential collaborations.
